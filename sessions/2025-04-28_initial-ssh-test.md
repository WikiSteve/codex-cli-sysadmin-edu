# Codex CLI Session: Testing Remote SSH Execution

**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Goal:** Test if Codex CLI can execute commands remotely on a Windows Server 2025 Core machine (`172.16.171.132`) via SSH using its `shell()` tool.

---

## Initial Query: Interactive SSH?

**User**  
> So if I wanted to ssh to a machine now that I’m in Codex, can I do this? I have a Windows 2025 Core machine I’d like to co-work on with Codex.

**Codex**  
The short answer is no, not interactively. The Codex-CLI sandbox isn’t a full terminal emulator with a TTY you can hand off to an SSH session.

You can, however:

- SSH from your local machine (PowerShell, WSL, etc.) with  
  ```bash
  ssh user@windows2025
  ```
  then run `codex` there.

- Run specific remote commands non-interactively via the shell tool, for example:  
  ```javascript
  await shell({
    command: [
      "ssh",
      "user@windows2025",
      "dir", "C:\\Projects"
    ]
  })
  ```
  This will SSH in, run the one-off command, return the output, and exit.

For a true co-editing experience, SSH into your Windows box from your local terminal, then install and run Codex-CLI on that machine.

## Attempt 1: Remote Hostname & Ping (Password Auth Method)

**User**  
> With the `await shell`, can you determine the IP address of this host machine on the same network as the guest? Then SSH to `172.16.171.132` as `steve` (password `Windows1`), get the hostname, and do a ping test back to the host.

**Codex**  
```javascript
(async () => {
  // 1. Detect host IP on the same subnet
  const { stdout: ipOut } = await shell({
    command: [
      "bash", "-lc",
      "ip -4 addr show scope global \
       | awk '/inet /{print $2}'       \
       | cut -d'/' -f1                 \
       | grep '^172\\.16\\.171\\.'     \
       | head -n1"
    ]
  });
  const hostIP = ipOut.trim();
  console.log(`Detected host IP: ${hostIP}`);

  // 2. SSH into the Windows box and run hostname & ping
  const sshArgs = [
    "sshpass", "-p", "Windows1", // Using sshpass for password auth
    "ssh", "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no",
    "steve@172.16.171.132",
    `powershell -NoProfile -Command "hostname; ping -n 4 ${hostIP}"`
  ];
  const { stdout: out, stderr: err } = await shell({ command: sshArgs });
  if (err) console.error(err);
  console.log(out);
})();
```

> **Notes:**  
> - You need `sshpass` installed or to set up key-based auth.  
> - On Windows Core, wrap commands in PowerShell.

---

## Attempt 2: Switching to Key-Based Auth (Initial Failure)

**User**  
> I ran `ssh-copy-id`. Does it work now?

**Codex**  
```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no steve@172.16.171.132 hostname
```

**Output:**  
```
Warning: Permanently added '172.16.171.132' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
steve@172.16.171.132: Permission denied (publickey,password,keyboard-interactive).
```

**Codex**  
Key-based auth isn’t going through yet. On Windows Core you may need to:

1. Verify your public key is in `C:\Users\steve\.ssh\authorized_keys`  
2. Check that only “steve” (and SYSTEM) can read that file  
3. Ensure `AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys` is set in `C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config`  
4. Restart SSH with  
   ```powershell
   Restart-Service sshd
   ```

Then try again:
```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes steve@172.16.171.132 hostname
```
If you get the hostname without a password prompt, key-only login works.

---

## Attempt 3: Testing Key-Based Auth Again

**User**  
> Now it should work :)

**Codex**  
```javascript
// 1. Detect host IP on 172.16.171.0/24 subnet
const { stdout: ipOut } = await shell({
  command: [
    "bash", "-lc",
    "ip -4 addr show scope global       \
     | awk '/inet /{print $2}'          \
     | cut -d/ -f1                      \
     | grep '^172\\.16\\.171\\.'        \
     | head -n1"
  ]
});
const hostIP = ipOut.trim();
console.log(`Using host IP: ${hostIP}`);

// 2. SSH in and run hostname + ping (key-based)
const { stdout: remoteOut, stderr } = await shell({
  command: [
    "ssh",
    "-o", "BatchMode=yes",         // key-only, non-interactive
    "-o", "StrictHostKeyChecking=no",
    "steve@172.16.171.132",
    `powershell -NoProfile -Command "hostname; ping -n 4 ${hostIP}"`
  ]
});

if (stderr) console.error(stderr);
console.log(remoteOut);
```

If you see the hostname and four ping replies without a password prompt, key-only SSH works end-to-end.

## User Clarifies

**User**  
> Bud, I’m trying to see if Codex can actually SSH into this machine and run commands.

**Codex**  
Yes – Codex can SSH in and run commands, but only in a non-interactive, one-off way via the `shell()` tool.

---

## Attempt 4: Refining Remote Command (Get-ChildItem) & Debugging

**User**  
> I’ve verified that the same user I’m running Codex from can SSH using the key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. It works interactively. I just want to see if you can SSH in, do something, like show me a directory listing, and report the results back.

**Codex** runs:
```bash
ssh -i /home/steve/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -o BatchMode=yes \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  steve@172.16.171.132 \
  powershell -NoProfile -Command 'Get-ChildItem C:\\Users\\Steve'
```

**Output:**  
```
steve@172.16.171.132: Permission denied (publickey,password,keyboard-interactive).
```

**Codex**  
Permission denied again. Since your interactive login works, try agent forwarding or verify the key setup on the Server-Core box.

**User**  
> Oh! Make sure you’re using the `steve` login (that’s the login to the remote host).

**Codex** tries agent forwarding, still fails, and reviews SSHD troubleshooting.

---

## Final Attempt & Success

**User**  
> Bud! It should work now!

**Codex** runs:
```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  steve@172.16.171.132 \
  powershell -NoProfile -Command 'Get-ChildItem C:\\Users\\Steve'
```

**Output:**  
```
    Directory: C:\Users\Steve

```

**Codex**  
Success! Codex SSH’d in as `steve` and ran a directory listing. This confirms non-interactive SSH works on your Server Core VM.
