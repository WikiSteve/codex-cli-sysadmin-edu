Pilot project exploring Codex CLI for sysadmin and networking education at NSCC.
# Codex CLI for SysAdmin Education (NSCC Pilot)

This project explores the integration of OpenAI's **Codex CLI** tool into **system administration and networking education** at **Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)**. The goal is to evaluate Codex CLI’s terminal-native and multimodal capabilities for real-world IT operations training.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Pilot **Codex CLI** in lab-style sysadmin tasks
- Evaluate its ability to interpret:
  - CLI commands
  - Log files
  - System configurations
  - Visual artifacts (screenshots, diagrams)
- Measure usefulness for student learning and automation literacy
- Share findings and feedback with OpenAI and the open-source community

## 🧪 Pilot Scope

| Focus Area              | Sample Activities                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🛠️ Command Understanding | Explain `iptables`, `systemctl`, `find`, etc.     |
| 📁 File/Script Analysis  | Review Bash/PowerShell/Ansible snippets          |
| 🔍 Log Interpretation    | Analyze `/var/log/syslog`, auth.log, etc.        |
| 📸 Visual Interpretation | Use `--image` to understand diagrams/screenshots |

## 🔄 Status

Phase 1 (Multimodal Pilot) underway.  
Results and open-source lab modules will be shared here soon.
